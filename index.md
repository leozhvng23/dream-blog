## About Me
I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic Computer Science Master's student at Columbia University, specializing in Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Computer Vision. Before embarking on this journey, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Industrial Design from Pratt Institute, with a concentrated focus on User Experience Design and Accessible Design.

My diverse academic background, combining the creative rigors of design with the methodical thinking of computer science, sparked my profound interest in HCI. The fusion of these two fields not only satiates my intellectual curiosity but also provides me with a unique perspective in addressing complex issues.

When I'm not engrossed in studies or working on intriguing projects, you'll likely find me scaling walls as a rock climbing enthusiast or zipping through streets on my road bike. I'm also a connoisseur of specialty coffee, always in search of that perfect blend and brew. This medley of experiences and interests shapes who I am, a perpetual learner committed to making a difference at the intersection of technology and design.

## About My Advisor

[Brian Smith](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~brian/) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, where he directs the Computer-Enabled Abilities Laboratory (CEAL) and contributes to the Data, Media, and Society Center, as well as the [Center for Smart Streetscapes](https://cs3-erc.org/) of the Data Science Institute. He has a strong industry background, having served as a research scientist at Snap Research, where he explored innovative ways to connect people through augmented reality (AR) and wearable technologies, translating his research into practical applications like Friendscope and ARcall.

## About My Project

People with blindness or low vision (BLV) often rely on GPS systems for outdoor navigation. These tools offer general direction but lack precise, real-time data about a user's immediate surroundings which is essential for safe movement. We are exploring the potential of street cameras as a solution to this limitation. Through preliminary interviews with six BLV individuals, we pinpointed three core navigation challenges they face: understanding the layout of their surroundings, sidestepping obstacles during transit, and safely crossing busy streets. To tackle these issues, we're in the process of creating a navigation aid based on street cameras. This system aims to give auditory cues in real-time to BLV users, aiding in avoiding obstacles, signaling the best times to cross streets, and offering insight into the environment's layout.

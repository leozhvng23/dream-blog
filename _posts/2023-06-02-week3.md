title: Week 3 - Combine & Refine Computer Vision Detection System
---

Week 3 was all about getting hands-on with code. Koushik and I teamed up to bring together pedestrian detection (thanks to the CLIP model) and prediction (powered by the Kalman filter). Most of our time was diving into the code, cleaning it up, and making sure both systems talked to each other nicely. We wrapped it up with a video that shows the 2nd floor camera view on one side and a bird's-eye view from the 12th floor on the other. Plus, I added labels to show some details like BLV user IDs, positions, and how close they were to the safe zones.

We also had Dan and Xinyi join the team this week through the Amazon SURE program. It's always great to have more hands on deck, especially since we're building a system that's fairly large and complex. With the team growing, I'm mixing things up for the rest of the summer. I'll be moving away from the server-side and diving into designing and building out the iOS frontend. Exciting times ahead!

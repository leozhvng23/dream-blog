Week 5 saw a pivot from my usual coding activities, as Xinyi and I embarked on an intensive design phase, essentially a design sprint on Figma. Our initial step was to research existing apps catered to BLV users. We wanted to grasp prevalent design strategies, understand typical UX flows, and pick out common UI elements. Compiling our findings, we created a mood board filled with screenshots and inspirations, fostering a collaborative discussion on potential design pathways. Two design approaches caught our attention: Google Maps' navigation layout and Apple's intuitive 'Find My Items' UI. 

With a clearer vision in mind, we took to traditional paper and pen, sketching out prospective screens. These sketches were then shared and reviewed with the broader team. Once we achieved consensus on a design direction, we transitioned to Figma, converting our sketches to higher-fidelity designs and culminating in a clickable prototype.

The team also saw new additions this week: Josh, Chloe, Sophie Ana, and Michael. Josh and Chloe are set to collaborate with Dan and Koushik on backend tasks, while Sophie Ana joins Xinyi and me on the frontend journey. Michael, a BLV user, offers a unique perspective, assisting us with prototype testing. We're anticipating his feedback on our Figma prototype next week. If all aligns, we're gearing up to initiate the development phase of the iOS app. On a personal note, I'm immersing myself in Swift, a language I haven't worked with before. Thankfully, my background in React, React Native, Vue, and general full-stack development should make the transition smoother. The forthcoming weeks are brimming with potential, and I'm eager to see where this journey takes us.

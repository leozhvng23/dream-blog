title: Week 12 - Art, Farewells, and New Beginnings
---

It feels like just yesterday that the summer programs began and the undergraduate students, both from REU and SURE, started with us. This week marked the culmination of their journey. Their enthusiasm, fresh perspectives, and hard work have been instrumental in pushing our project to its current stage. Their departure will surely leave a void, but we are also armed with the knowledge and progress theyâ€™ve contributed.

On Monday the entire lab, along with Professor Smith, took a field trip to MOMA. It was a great opportunity not just to appreciate the art but to bond with the team in a setting outside of our regular work environment. Beyond the technical jargon, tight schedules, and work pressure, it was refreshing to see everyone in a relaxed mode, chatting about art, life, and everything in between. The trip was capped off with a hearty Indian lunch, and the flavors and conversations around the table made it an experience to cherish.

Next week we will transition into the testing phase, where our hard work will be put to the test. While the outing was a much needed break, the path ahead is clear and challenging, but we're ready.

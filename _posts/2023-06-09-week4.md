title: Week 4 - From Backend Coding to Frontend Design

This week was marked by a dual focus. Initially, Koushik, Mingyu, and I grappled with a technical challenge on the server-side. The new dataset's framerate wasnâ€™t aligning with our existing code, an issue pivotal because our system relies heavily on frame-specific data and the Kalman filter to predict pedestrian movements. A mismatched framerate could erroneously suggest a stationary pedestrian when they're actually moving. After extensive troubleshooting, we implemented solutions, notably adjusting the framerate count and introducing a dictionary mechanism to remember a pedestrian's last known position, harmonizing the system with the new dataset.

Shifting gears to frontend development, Xinyi and I began laying the groundwork for the app's UI/UX design. Revisiting my design training from Pratt was both nostalgic and exciting, providing a fresh perspective in a tech-dominated context. To bring the team up to speed, I elucidated the foundational steps of the UX/UI design process I was taught. Together, we brainstormed user objectives for our app, segmented these goals, and brainstormed the user flow associated with each. The collective effort culminated in a detailed UX flow and a sitemap for the iOS app, mapped out on Figma. With the foundational flow established, the upcoming focus is on sculpting low-fidelity mockups in Figma to refine our user experience.

title: Week 1 - Onboarding
---

This past week marked an enriching and exciting phase in my research journey at Columbia University's Computer-Enabled Abilities Laboratory (CEAL). I had the opportunity to meet with Gaurav Jain, the Ph.D. student leading our project, as well as my research peers, Koushik and Mingyu. Additionally, I met with my research advisor, Prof. Brian Smith, receiving a comprehensive overview of the diverse projects currently underway at CEAL this summer.

A significant part of our meeting was dedicated to understanding the Pedestrian Navigation project I'll be working on. This project aims to enhance the safety and accessibility of blind or low-vision pedestrians crossing the streets. Using machine learning principles, specifically computer vision and street cameras, we plan to develop an innovative Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system. 

Being a part of the Center for Smart Street Scapes, our mission is to leverage technology to create smarter and more inclusive future cities. This project's objective aligns seamlessly with that mission, and I'm thrilled to contribute to this impactful work.

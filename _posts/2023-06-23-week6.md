title: Week 6 - From Prototype to Working iOS App

This week unfolded as an intense iOS development marathon. Building upon my background in full-stack development, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I could transfer from React and Vue to Swift. To ensure organized and scalable code, I emphasized a component-based architecture. Analyzing our Figma design, I identified recurring UI patterns and structures, which led me to develop a set of reusable components. As a stepping stone, this modular approach made the app-building process substantially more seamless than anticipated.

Navigating Swift, however, presented its unique challenges. Accustomed to the dynamic typing of Python and JavaScript, Swift's strong typing system required a conscious shift in coding habits. Plus, Swift's syntax was a departure from what I was familiar with. Although I often consulted ChatGPT for guidance, Swift's rapid evolution meant some advice was outdated. This necessitated direct consultations with Swift's official documentation, which, though comprehensive, could sometimes feel fragmented and less intuitive.

In terms of tangible outcomes, by week's end, I managed to translate around 80% of our Figma prototype into a functional iOS application, marking a significant milestone for the project.

In parallel, our team delved deep into refining the navigation mechanics, especially concerning veering adjustments. Our preliminary veering feedback system leverages spatial audio cues. When a user drifts outside a predefined "safety cone", an audio signal nudges them back on track. This cone's angle is dynamically determined, anchored at the user's position, spanning to the crosswalk's edges. A potential issue we foresee is the cone's tapering width, which could be especially narrow at the crosswalk's start, possibly causing user frustration. However, our current focus remains on achieving a fully operational system; fine-tuning the veering mechanism will follow suit.

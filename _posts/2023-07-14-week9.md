title: Week 9 - Streamlining the App User Flow

This week marked a significant pivot in our app's user experience design. Fresh off the back of our successful [ASSETS](https://assets23.sigaccess.org/) poster submission, we dived deep into the user study feedback, which shone light on some of the app's existing complexities. 

The distinction between 'explore' and 'guidance' modes, while conceptually clear to us developers, appeared to confuse some users. This was a crucial realization. Clarity and simplicity are paramount, especially considering that our primary user base consists of BLV individuals. Any redundancy or complexity in the user flow could potentially hinder the usability of our app, undermining our primary goal of ensuring seamless street navigation.

Drawing on this feedback, I revisited our Figma prototype. The revamp aimed to merge the 'explore' and 'guidance' modes into a singular, cohesive user flow. The proposed workflow begins with an interactive map screen, allowing users to acquaint themselves with the surroundings. This 'exploration' phase transitions into a list of nearby points of interest. Once a destination is chosen, the user is provided a summary of the guidance route. Initiating the guidance seamlessly transitions them to an enhanced map view. Most navigation cues – from veering feedback to crosswalk signals – would be audio-driven, ensuring an uninterrupted and intuitive user experience.

The revised design, though streamlined, will still need rigorous validation. We're planning user studies with BLV participants to gauge the efficacy and intuitiveness of our new design. With an upcoming paper submission deadline in September, time is of the essence. The goal is to finalize system and app modifications by the end of next week, setting the stage for focused user testing sessions. The journey continues, and the learning never stops!

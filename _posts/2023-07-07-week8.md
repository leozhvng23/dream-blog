This week can be summed up in a single phrase: adrenaline-packed. Each one of us, filled with fervor and determination, made collective strides to ensure we met the ASSETS poster submission deadline. The unity, hard work, and dedication displayed by the team are commendable, and the sense of shared achievement is genuinely uplifting.

My primary focus this week revolved around crafting the demo video for our submission. A trip down memory lane it was, as I revisited skills from a course I took during my freshman year at Pratt Institute. Adobe Premiere Pro, a tool I hadn't touched in ages, became my close companion. Video editing, I realized once again, is more than just piecing clips together; it's a form of storytelling. How do you ensure viewers remain engaged throughout? How do you articulate your ideas lucidly without overwhelming them? These questions steered my editing process. Crafting a story that is cohesive, engaging, and informative is no easy task, especially when it has to encapsulate the depth and breadth of our project succinctly.

After creating and refining four drafts, fueled by feedback and multiple reviews, I finally had a version that I felt did justice to our work. While the journey was arduous, filled with tedious edits and rearrangements, the satisfaction upon seeing the final product was unparalleled. As we wrap up this week, I'm filled with gratitude for the learning experiences, the camaraderie of my team, and the milestones we've crossed together.

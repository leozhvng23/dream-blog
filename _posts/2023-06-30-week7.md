The week presented a whirlwind of activities as I oscillated between frontend and backend work. With growing concerns about our existing navigation and veering system, Gaurav and I, after a consultative session with Professor Smith, decided that a pivot was needed. We realized that introducing an entirely new navigation mechanism might overshadow our primary focus on street cameras. To retain this centrality, we took cues from established guidance systems. Delving into the NavCog and NavCog3 papers, we found merit in their waypoint-based guidance system.

The flow of the new navigation system is straightforward - the user is presented with a list of points of interest (POIs) and selects their final destination. From there, they're guided via a series of waypoints. To actualize this on our platform, we had to transform our map into a graph, where each waypoint corresponds to a node. Implementing the shortest path algorithm would then yield the optimal sequence of waypoints leading to the chosen destination. With the clock ticking towards the [ASSETS](https://assets23.sigaccess.org/) poster submission deadline, this overhaul required swift action. Koushik and I divided tasks efficiently: he structured the nodes and edges in a JSON file while I spearheaded the graph implementation and pathfinding. Employing the A* algorithm, I was thrilled to have the shortest path calculations up and running within a day!

Next, I returned to the frontend, specifically, refining the auditory feedback for veering. The Apple developer documentation on the audio engine provided crucial insights. I developed two distinct versions of the veering screen. The first leveraged the audio engine to modulate the beeping sound's pitch and repetition rate based on the user's deviation from the safety cone, coupled with direction-based speaker outputs. The second iteration was simpler, only adjusting the beep's repetition rate. After some preliminary testing, the consensus favored the latter for its straightforwardness and reduced potential for distractions.

The week concluded on a high, with both our app and system geared up for the [ASSETS](https://assets23.sigaccess.org/) poster submission. As we brace for the final week leading to the submission, the team is invigorated and ready to deliver.
